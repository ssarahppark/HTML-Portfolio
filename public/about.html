<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sarah Park. I just graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a B.S. in Computer Information Systems. I also work at an E-commerce company that operates in a warehouse and is a family business.  With my acquired skills and experience, I hope to enhance my dad's business and strive to make impact within the web development realm.  </p>

<p>My skills include data entry, customer service, digital marketing, data analysis, Google Analytics, SEO, E-commerce, Statistics, Account Management, Business, Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365 in my work and school environments. I colloborated in projects to create actionable recommendations for a business, create mock websites that follow UI/UX Design concepts, present mock Board of Directors Presentations in a bike business simulator program, manage Etsy account and other E-commerce platforms, such as Walmart and eBay. </p>

<p>Outside of pursuing my web development career and enhancing my soft skills, I have created a few goals along the way. First goal is to exercise more and be more cautious of what I consume in my body. Second goal is to maintain a healthy hobby for at least a month. Third goal is to work on my mental health, emotional intelligence and regulation. Fourth is to always work hard but remember to appreciate the little things in each day. Time is precious. </p>
